%% The best way to work with the dialyzer is to use it at every stage of develop-
%% ment. When you start writing a new module, think about the types first and
%% declare them before you write your code. Write type specifications for all the
%% exported functions in your module. Do this first before you start writing the
%% code. You can comment out the type specs of the functions that you have not
%% yet implemented and then uncomment them as you implement the functions.

%% Can Add type specifications if the function is exported.
