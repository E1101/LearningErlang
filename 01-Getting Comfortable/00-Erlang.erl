%% What makes a true functional programming language is the fact that functions
%% can be handled just like any other sort of data.

%% Functional data types in Erlang are called funs. They can be passed as arguments to other
%% functions and they can be stored in data structures like tuples and records or sent as messages to
%% other processes.
