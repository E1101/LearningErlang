%% A supervision tree is a tree of processes. The upper processes (supervisors)
%% in the tree monitor the lower processes (workers) in the tree and restart the
%% lower processes if they fail.

% - One-for-one supervision trees
%   if a worker fails, it is restarted by the supervisor.
%
% - One-for-all supervision trees
%   if any worker dies, then all the worker processes
%   are killed (by calling the terminate/2 function in the appropriate callback
%   module). Then all the worker processes are restarted.


% To do this, weâ€™ll write yet another callback module, this time for gen_supervisor .

{Tag, {Mod, Func, ArgList}, % the function that the supervisor will use to start the worker.
  % Restart = permanent | transient | temporary
  Restart,
  % maximum time a worker is allowed
  % to take in terminating. If it takes longer
  % than this, it will be killed.
  Shutdown,
  % Type = worker | supervisor
  % We can construct a tree of
  % supervisors by adding supervisor processes
  % in place of worker processes.
  Type,
  % the name of the callback module if the child process
  % is a supervisor or gen_server behavior callback module
